# Novus _Deceptus_
Novus _Deceptus_ is a hacked client for Terraria. Original code copyright ReLogic (New code uploaded within the week)



Features:



### Lighting
`/light` toggles light on/off

`/light <brightness>` sets light brightness. `brightness` is an number from 0 (off) to 255 (full on)

`/light <r> <g> <b>` sets light red green blue component. `r, g, b` are all numbers from 0 (off) to 255 (full on)

`/disco` toggles disco lighting around you on/off

### Block Mining
`/boxmine` toggles the function to press the `k` key to mine all blocks within 10 blocks of you. When on, press (and hold) `k` to mine at will.

`/destroy_world yes` mines all blocks in the world (that are able to be mined) when the user clicks `Yes` to a confirmation that appears. This lags a lot, and when it's done we reccomend saving and reloading your world asap.

### Cheats
`/heal` heals the player of mana and health

`/give <item ID>` gives the player an item with the id of `<item ID>`

`/god` toggles `godmode` on/off. See `godmode.md` for list of things it does.

`/tp` teleports your player to your mouse
