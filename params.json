{"name":"Deceptus","tagline":"Novus Deceptus is a hacked client for Terraria","body":"# Novus _Deceptus_\r\nNovus _Deceptus_ is a hacked client for Terraria. Original code copyright ReLogic. Please note that this client _will not work_ unless you have bought and played (at least once) Terraria, as this is not a _cracked client_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lighting\r\n`/light` toggles light on/off.\r\n\r\n`/light <brightness>` sets light brightness. `brightness` is an number from 0 (off) to 255 (full on).\r\n\r\n`/light <r> <g> <b>` sets light red green blue component. `r, g, b` are all numbers from 0 (off) to 255 (full on).\r\n\r\n`/disco` toggles disco lighting around you on/off.\r\n\r\n### Block Mining\r\n`/boxmine` toggles the function to press the `k` key to mine all blocks within 10 blocks of you. When on, press (and hold) `k` to mine at will.\r\n\r\n`/boxmine square` switches the k-mine shape to a 10x10 block square. Default.\r\n\r\n`/boxmine circle` switches the k-mine shape to a 10 block (diameter) circle.\r\n\r\n`/boxmine front` switches the k-mine shape to the 3 blocks in front of you.\r\n\r\n`/destroy_world yes` mines all blocks in the world (that are able to be mined, i.e. not full chests or the blocks under them) when the user clicks `Yes` to a confirmation that appears. This lags a lot, and when it's done we reccomend saving and reloading your world asap.\r\n\r\n### Cheats\r\n`/heal` heals the player of mana and health.\r\n\r\n`/give <item ID>` gives the player an item with the id of `<item ID>`. `<item ID>` can be the item name (no spaces) or it's numeric ID.\r\n\r\n`/god` toggles `godmode` on/off.
